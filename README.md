## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I think I have to study top - down dp and recursive dp.

I founded that I have check all possible cases and I have to use recursive function to do that, but implementing was very hard.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
